# For Loop Exercises

1 . Print the folowing to the console using a for loop.

`````
    * * * * * * * * * *
    * * * * * * * * * *
    * * * * * * * * * *
    * * * * * * * * * *
    * * * * * * * * * *
    * * * * * * * * * *
    * * * * * * * * * *
    * * * * * * * * * *
    * * * * * * * * * *
    * * * * * * * * * *
`````

2 . Using a for loop, print this to your console:

`````
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
`````    

3 . Create a method called greet(), that takes an int as a parameter. The method should print out hello there the amount of times specified in the methods parameter.

`````
    // Example:
    greet(3);
    // Should print
    Hello
    Hello
    Hello
`````

4 . Create a method called print(), that takes an int as a parameter. The method should print out the same as in exercise 1, but should be able to print out a dynamic amount of stars according to the number specified in the parameter.

`````
    // Example
    print(3);
    // Should print
    * * *
    * * *
    * * *
    * * *
    * * *
    * * *
    * * *
    * * *
    * * *
    * * *

`````
5 . Do the same as exercise 5, but now the method should print the same as in exercise 2.

`````
    // Example
    print(3);
    // Should print
    * * *
    * * *
    * * *

    print(5);
    // Should print
    * * * * * 
    * * * * * 
    * * * * * 
    * * * * * 
    * * * * * 

`````
6 . Print the folowing to the console using 2 for loops.

`````
    * 
    * * 
    * * * 
    * * * * 
    * * * * * 
    * * * * * * 
    * * * * * * * 
    * * * * * * * *  
    * * * * * * * * * 
    * * * * * * * * * *
`````

7 . Create an Array of Integers, whith a length of 1000.
    * **Adding number to the Array**
        * Using a loop you should add even numbers starting at 2.
    * **Reading from the Array**
        * Add (+) all numbers in the array and print the _sum_ to the console. 
        * find the avarage of all the numbers in the array and print it to the console
        * Find the highest number in the Array and print it to the console. _(Here you should imagine that you do not now that the array has a length of 1000 and that you only put in even numbers starting at 2 - actually this could change :))_
